Since Fall 2017, I have used Git, GitHub, and GitHub Classroom to manage distribution of starter code for labs and other assignments, distribution of many class examples, and submission and grading for most assignments.  This document describes the way I've done this.  I make no promises that any of this will work for you, but I provide it just in case it does.  I welcome suggestion on how better to use these and other tools in classroom settings.

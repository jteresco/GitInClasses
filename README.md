Since Fall 2017, I have used Git, GitHub, and GitHub Classroom to manage distribution of starter code for labs and other assignments, distribution of many class examples, and submission and grading for most assignments.  This document describes the way I've done this.  I make no promises that any of this will work for you, but I provide it just in case it does.  I welcome suggestion on how better to use these and other tools in classroom settings.

I have found this to be a great benefit both to me and to my students.  It's almost always more convenient for me, often much more so, and it's very helpful for the students to gain proficiency with version control.  As I like to tell them, I don't think many potential employers are going to be impressed by your skills at uploading assignments to Blackboard or Canvas.

## One-Time Setup

You will need, of course, an account on GitHub.  You can apply for an "academic discount" for your account, as long as its attached to your school-issued email, which gives you unlimited free, private repositories.  Details of this process tend to change over time, but all you need should be found somewhere at the [GitHub Education site](https://education.github.com).

## Per-Course Setup

I have a GitHub organization for each course in which I use GitHub (Data Structures, Algorithms, Parallel Processing, so far) that has repositories for things like lab or assignment starter code and class examples.  Then for each semester when I offer the course, I create a new GitHub organization specific to that offering.  That's where all of the repositories the students will be creating and using will live.  The reasons for this and how to do it can be found [here](https://github.com/jfiksel/github-classroom-for-teachers).  I have simplified my process somewhat, as I have been the sole instructor on each course in which I've used GitHub to date.  I also have not bothered adding students as "members" of the organization.  Their default role as "outside collaborators" seems to work just fine.

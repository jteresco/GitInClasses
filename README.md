Since Fall 2017, I have used Git, GitHub, and GitHub Classroom to manage distribution of starter code for labs and other assignments, distribution of many class examples, and submission and grading for most assignments.  This document describes the way I've done this.  I make no promises that any of this will work for you, but I provide it just in case it does.  I welcome suggestion on how better to use these and other tools in classroom settings.

I have found this to be a great benefit both to me and to my students.  It's almost always more convenient for me, often much more so, and it's very helpful for the students to gain proficiency with version control.  As I like to tell them, I don't think many potential employers are going to be impressed by your skills at uploading assignments to Blackboard or Canvas.

## One-time Setup

You will need, of course, an account on GitHub.  You can apply for an "academic discount" for your account, as long as its attached to your school-issued email, which gives you unlimited free, private repositories.  Details of this process tend to change over time, but all you need should be found somewhere at the [GitHub Education site](https://education.github.com).
